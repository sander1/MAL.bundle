		MyAnimeList.net was created by an anime fan, for anime fans. It was designed from the ground up to give the user a quick and no-hassle way to catalog their anime or manga collection. Over 40,000 users sign in every day to help build the world's largest social anime and manga database and community.

MyAnimeList targets users of all varieties in an effort to provide personalized suggestions, to connect users who share similar tastes, to provide detailed anime or manga information, and much more.

Created and actively maintained by Garrett Gyssler, MyAnimeList is a community run entirely by its moderators and users from all over the world.
